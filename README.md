Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to find all the prime integers in a given number, or to create a pascal's triangle based on the user's input for number of rows. 

Inputs:
run_again 
user_num (for prime nums) 
user_rows (for pascals triangle)

Expected Output:
should return correct prime integers in range (2 - user_num).
should print correct pascal's pyramid with correct number of rows.
should prompt the user to re-enter a number if it is less than 0 [-]

Types of execution:

Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired. 
Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom. 
Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes. 
Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program.

Possible Improvements:

- not sure if the starting value / calculations are correct for the pascal's triangle.
- kind of cluttered, code could be structured better.
- run_again statements after each code execution was having issues. (probably indentation error)
